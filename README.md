## SESSION TROUBLESHOOT

If you asked to enter phone number again after sessions creation, it mean session not initialized correctly, try to delete the created sessions.

Example Case

- example you already have 1 session (sessionA) and all good when you run bot. After that you create another session, but when you run bot, the bot asked to enter phone number again, so the problem is on (sessionB), to fix it just remove the `accounts/sessionB` folder and re create it or just delete all folder inside `accounts` directory with prefix `sessions-`.

## QUERY TROUBLESHOOT

if your bot get eror, with some error code `401` it mean your query expired, go get new query and run bot again and choose option `4` for query modification.

## NOTE

You can configure bot by opening `config.js` file and modify some of this param
```js
static DISPLAY = "BLESS"; //TWIST or BLESS Display
static USEAUTOUPGRADE = true; //USE AUTO UPGRADE OR NO
static REPAINTER = true; //USE INCORRECT COLOR REPAINTER
static CUSTOMDELAYINMIN = undefined; //CUSTOM DELAY IN MINUTES EX : 60 = 60 minutes
static TEMPLATE = {
   templateID: 446378180,
   startArea: 116450,
   endArea: 165575,
   correctColor: "#6D482F",
}; //configure fren template by finding the id, color, start area and end area (is a rectangle start from top left, and end on bottom right)
```

Don't use bot with `session` type if you using telegram account that bought from someone because it can make your telegram account deleted. instead of using `session` type, use `query` type.

This bot can use Telegram Query and Telegram Sessions. if you want to use sessions, and ever use one of my bot that use telegram sessions, you can just copy the `accounts` folder to this bot. Also for the telegram APP ID and Hash you can use it from another bot. If you want to use Telegram Query, get your query manually.

if you got error `Invalid ConstructorId` try to run this `npm i telegram@2.22.2`
